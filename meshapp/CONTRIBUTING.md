## Issue Tracking and Management

We use GitHub Projects to manage and track issues for the Let's Mesh project. You can find our [project board here](https://github.com/orgs/LetsMesh/projects/2).

### How to Report an Issue

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue (bug/task), please check if the issue has already been reported to avoid duplications.
2. **Open a New Issue**: If the issue does not exist, open a new issue and provide as much detail as possible. For bug reporting, please provide the steps to reproduce the bug.
3. **Link to Project Board**: Ensure your issue is linked to the project board for better tracking.

### How to Work on an Issue

1. **Assign Yourself**: If you are interested in working on an issue, assign it to yourself.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch from `dev` with a descriptive name related to the issue.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you have completed your work, submit a pull request (PR) and link it to the issue.
